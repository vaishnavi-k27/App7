the illness_count variables start at 0 before any questions are answered 
and are added to when the user clicks yes or no (depending on the question). The functions 
for illnessAdd are simple because they just add 1 to the corresponding count as buttons are clicked on the questions pages. 
the variables illness_percent are defined here but not used until later in the code. 
Note that all code written in JavaScript is started and ended with the script closer. */

<!-- the code above is for the first question page of the website. it is divided from the title/ intro page by the <div>
and ends with </div>. each new page is started and closed by the <div> and </div>, as you will see below. This division is classified
as a page and is given the id of one because it's the first question page. The next division is identifying the page header and the header 
title is Question 1. The question 1 header is displayed on the screen because it is between the <h1> and </h1> which identify a header type. 
The header division is closed off by a </div> (as always) and a new division starts. This next division holds the content of the page.
Here we ask the first question, which is surrounded by the <p> and </p>, which are paragraph elements. These allow you to write between 
them. We see the button function again (<a> </a>) but there are four this time. when clicked,
the buttons take the user to the page identified in href= . (This is the case for all buttons, except the results button on the results
page, because it is the last page and the results appear right there on that page, so there is no href for that button.) All buttons are
coded as black with white text and when a button is clicked, the corresponding function (which is named after the onclick=) runs and adds
a number to the proper variables described above. The buttons display the text between the > </a> and vary for each question and illness. 
when they click, depending on the question and the answer, a point will be added to proper illness_counts, using the functions
above. This format of adding a division for each page, identifying it with a number and using more divisions to create the appropriate 
headers, questions, and buttons (with adding counts), is repeated for the next twelve questions pages. The basic formula of each page is 
the same, but the questions asked (between the <p> </p>) and the onclick commands (which add to the correct illness_counts) 
change with every page. some onclick commands have multiple functions to run because some illnesses share the same symptoms-->

<!-- This is the last page of the app 7 and it is identified as the results page. The first division is similar to 
the other pages at the header, but changes from there. Here I use JavaScript to create a new function called Results() to calculate 
the probability each illness. To make the Results() function with JavaScript, I used <script> and the variables set in the beginning 
code, like the illness_counts and illness_percents. I set corona_percent = corona_count/11 (which was collected
from the 11 questions) and divided by 11 because there were 11 questions. I did the same with the other illness variables.
To display the percentages, I used the code given to us in a previous app assignment. This code creates a variable to display the result text 
and then using the innerHTML command, displays the text for propabilities of each illness with their corresponding percentages. 
The <br> is used to break the text and go to the next line, like an enter key. I end with the </script> because I am done with the 
function and need to switch from JavaScript to HTML. The last part of the results page is a button that will display the percentages
I found with the Results() function. This will displayed because of the onclick= command. I end the page with the closing divisions. -->
